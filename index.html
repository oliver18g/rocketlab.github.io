  <h1>LAUNCH COMPLEX 1</h1>
  <h3>MAHIA, NEW ZEALAND<br>PRIVATE ORBITAL LAUNCH SITE</h3>
  <p>Rocket Lab offers the worldâ€™s only private orbital launch range in Mahia, New Zealand. This FAA compliant site can accommodate a launch rate of 120 flights per year and is licensed for a launch to occur every 72 hours. From the site it is possible to reach orbital inclinations from sun-synchronous through to 39 degrees. This enables a lower-cost launch option with a wide spectrum of orbital inclinations.
    <br>Construction is currently underway on a second launch pad at Launch Complex 1. Work on Pad B will be completed in late 2020, with concurrent launches from Launch Complex 1 possible within the next 12 months.</p>
